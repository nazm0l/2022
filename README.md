2022 is memorable for me.

I learned so many new technologies.

Such as:

1. MERN Stack
2. CPP
3. Java
4. C

Also, I learned more micro technology related to MERN.

I have 400 GitHub commits in 2022.

Inshaallah next year I will learn advanced topics about MERN and DSA. And I want to make 400 commits to 3000 commits next year.

Advance Happy New Year Guys.
